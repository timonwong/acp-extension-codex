# ACP adapter for Codex CLI

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acp-extension-codex)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acp-extension-codex)

Use [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) from [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) clients.

`acp-extension-codex` is a stdio ACP agent server. It starts the Codex App Server, translates ACP requests into Codex operations, and maps Codex events back into the client.

## Features

- ChatGPT, API key, and client-provided custom gateway authentication.
- Model, reasoning effort, fast mode, approval, and sandbox mode configuration.
- Concrete recommended model and reasoning-effort values through the opt-in [AIR recommended config values](docs/recommended-config-values-extension.md) capability.
- Text prompts, embedded context, images, resource links, and additional workspace directories.
- Shell command, file change, [permission request](docs/permission-extension.md), MCP tool call, terminal output, reasoning, plan, web search, image generation, image view, token usage, and review events.
- [Native ACP subagent sessions](docs/subagent-sessions.md) (after capability negotiation) with separate child histories and root-routed permissions; a legacy tool-call fallback otherwise.
- [Background terminal tasks](docs/async-tasks.md) in AIR, with task status and targeted stop support after capability negotiation.
- Without native subagent negotiation, subagent launches remain standard ACP tool calls with provider-neutral lifecycle data in `_meta.lody.task`; Codex thread details remain available in `_meta.codex`.
- Session-scoped long-running goals through the provider-neutral [goal extension](docs/goal-extension.md).
- [MCP Apps](docs/mcp-apps-extension.md) (after capability negotiation): tool calls that declare a `ui://` app carry a small descriptor, and the client loads the app, its resources, and app-visible tool calls through the adapter.
- A per-turn [agent file-change report](docs/agent-file-change-report.md) after capability negotiation.
- Client-provided MCP servers over command-based stdio config and HTTP transport.
- Native ACP session forking through Codex App Server `thread/fork`.
- Acknowledged steering of an active Codex turn through app-server `turn/steer`.
- Slash commands: `/status`, `/mcp`, `/skills`, `/goal`, `/review`, `/review-branch`, `/review-commit`, `/compact`, and `/logout`, as well as configured skills.

## Installation

Run the published package directly:

```bash
npx -y acp-extension-codex
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g acp-extension-codex
acp-extension-codex --version
```

The npm package includes a compatible `@openai/codex` dependency. Set `CODEX_PATH` only when you want the adapter to run a different Codex binary:

```bash
CODEX_PATH=/path/to/codex npx -y acp-extension-codex
```

## Authentication

The adapter advertises ACP auth methods during initialization. Clients can authenticate with:

- ChatGPT login. Set `NO_BROWSER=1` to hide this method in remote or browserless environments.
- API key via `CODEX_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- A custom OpenAI-compatible gateway, when the client opts in to the gateway auth capability.

## Lody extensions

The initialize response advertises versioned capabilities under
`agentCapabilities._meta.lody`. Methods and payloads come from
`acp-extension-core`; this includes usage and rate-limit reporting, an independent
rate-limit query, acknowledged steering, goals, subagent/background-task lifecycle,
compaction lifecycle, history reads, and MCP Apps hosting. ACP-standard plans, elicitation, session
forking, and context-window usage stay on their standard protocol paths.

For a managed ChatGPT profile, new, resume, fork, and stable load keep saved
credentials on native refresh failure. A reused refresh token yields ACP error
data with `kind: "codex_refresh_contention"` so Lody can retry session startup
once in a fresh process. Other refresh failures carry no retry marker. Legacy
`session/load` keeps its original error behavior and does not auto-logout.

Usage reporting assigns differences between native root-thread token snapshots
to the model selected for the submitted turn. Cache/input/output/reasoning buckets
remain disjoint. Each native turn reports its own cumulative totals, tagged with
notification-local `_meta.lody.usageScopeId` (Core usage scope; the legacy duplicate
`_meta.codex.usageTurnId` remains for older clients); Lody's matching CLI uses a stable
per-turn persistence identity so repeated delivery cannot count a turn twice.
Each update's `delta` is that notification's own increment, already included in
the turn totals.

Only the preceding native snapshot and current turn are held in memory. There is
no sidecar, historical model ledger or session metadata baseline. Native resume
snapshots are comparison points, not new usage; when unavailable, the first
notification is conservatively skipped. Subagents are not summed into the root,
and native resets, reroutes and crash recovery are best effort rather than exact
billing. A mid-turn UI selection change applies to the next submitted turn.

The adapter and Lody CLI must be deployed together for turn-scoped usage.
Unmarked older adapters keep their existing accounting scope. Old development
sidecars and persisted history are neither read nor automatically migrated.

Codex steering uses `_lody/session/steer` and confirms application with
`_lody/session/steer_applied`. It keeps the active turn's model, mode, and
configuration; slash commands cannot be steered.

Acknowledged steering is inject-or-refuse. When no turn can accept input, the
adapter rejects with JSON-RPC `invalid request` (`-32600`), proving that the
message was not delivered. Lody requeues that same message as an ordinary
`session/prompt` after the current prompt finishes; the adapter never starts a
detached replacement turn. Internal and transport errors remain ambiguous unless
matching live or persisted user-message evidence confirms application; a missing
history item does not prove non-delivery. `injected` is submission, not application; only
the correlated `steer_applied` notification transfers logical output ownership.

Review commands and manual `/compact` retain the ACP prompt during cancellation
until native completion or connection closure. Cancellation during startup waits
for the native turn id before interrupting it; an interrupt acknowledgement alone
does not allow another prompt to start.

## Runtime options

- `CODEX_API_KEY` - API key used when the API-key auth method is selected. Takes precedence over `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - fallback API key used when the API-key auth method is selected.
- `CODEX_PATH` - run a specific Codex executable instead of the bundled package dependency.
- `CODEX_CONFIG` - JSON object merged into the Codex session config.
- `MODEL_PROVIDER` - model provider to pass to Codex for new sessions.
- `DEFAULT_AUTH_REQUEST` - ACP auth request JSON used when Codex requires authentication.
- `INITIAL_AGENT_MODE` - initial mode id: `read-only`, `agent`, `agent-auto-review`, or `agent-full-access`.
- `NO_BROWSER` - hide browser-based ChatGPT auth when set.
- `APP_SERVER_LOGS` - directory for adapter logs.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run start
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Build standalone binaries in `dist/bin` with:

```bash
npm run bundle:all
```

See [readme-dev.md](readme-dev.md) for local client configuration, binary packaging, and Codex type regeneration.

### Subagent sessions

Subagent sessions follow the draft [ACP subagent RFD](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/pull/1992) and are enabled only after bilateral capability negotiation during `initialize`. Without native negotiation, the subagent lifecycle stays an ordinary ACP tool call.

See [docs/subagent-sessions.md](docs/subagent-sessions.md) for the negotiation, lifecycle events, `session/load` reconstruction, and legacy fallback details.

### Background terminal tasks

Codex can keep a shell command running after a turn continues. AIR clients can show this work in the Async Tasks panel and stop one command.

See [docs/async-tasks.md](docs/async-tasks.md) for the capability, lifecycle events, and stop request.

### Local project worktrees

The adapter advertises Core `worktreeProject: { version: 1 }`. Clients can attach
`_meta.lody.worktreeProject: { version: 1, originProjectPath: "/original/project" }` when
creating, loading, resuming, or forking a session, while passing the actual
worktree path as ACP `cwd`. This requires the project APIs in the pinned Codex
0.156.0 runtime; older `CODEX_PATH` overrides may not support them.

The adapter derives a deterministic native project identity from the canonical
Lody project root and relies on Codex `project/create` idempotency for persistence
across sessions and adapter processes. It does not inspect or reuse user-created
projects by root, so multiple Codex projects may share that folder without making
Lody resolution ambiguous. If an adapter-owned project was deleted, the adapter
advances through a bounded sequence of deterministic generation keys (`:g1`, `:g2`,
and so on) until Codex creates or returns the first live generation. It never guesses
a replacement from matching roots, and generation 0 keeps the original key for
compatibility.

New sessions receive the deterministic project directly in `thread/start`.
Existing native thread project assignments remain authoritative on load, resume,
and fork; only unassigned threads are backfilled. Already persisted sessions are
backfilled when reopened, and there is no bulk migration of unrelated history.

Grouping keeps execution, permissions, and worktree cleanup with their existing
owners. It does not enable Codex-managed worktree badges or Handoff. Standard
`session/list.cwd` still filters execution directories. `ProjectApi.ts` contains
the narrow experimental native API subset omitted by stable type generation.

## Automatic session titles

The adapter advertises Core `agentCapabilities._meta.lody.sessionTitle: { version: 1 }`.
Its existing automatic generator names the native thread; native name updates are
published through ACP `session_info_update` with `_meta.lody.titleSource: "explicit"`.
Native name events do not distinguish generated names from manual renames. Prompt
previews remain `fallback` and cleared names `unset`, so clients can skip duplicate
generation without adopting a preview. Existing named/resumed sessions retain their
current title behavior; generation remains best effort.
